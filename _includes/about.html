                <h2>About NeuroHackademy</h2>
                <p>NeuroHackademy is an annual summer institute in neuroimaging and data science, held at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">University of Washington eScience Institute</a>. The institute brings together 60 early-career participants from a range of scientific backgrounds for a dynamic 2-week course of talks, tutorials, break-out periods, and collaborative hacking sessions. Participants will gain hands-on experience with technologies used to analyze human neuroscience data, will develop the ability to conduct reproducible, shareable analysis workflows, and will have the opportunity to collaboratively work on a diverse array of data analysis, software development, and other projects. The course is led by a faculty of nearly 20 renowned experts in neuroscience, informatics, and data science.</p>
